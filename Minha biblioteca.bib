	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the performance of the main models developed to quantify the Bullwhip Effect (BE) focusing on the impact due to the adoption of different policies to treat inventory excesses, under the assumption of stochastic demand and lead time. In addition to the policy assumed in most BE quantifi cation models available in the literature, where inventory excesses are handed back to suppliers at no cost, two alternative policies are investigated: (i) one where excesses are disregarded from the analysis, not motivating product devolution, and (ii) another where excesses are adjusted and used to supply for future demands. Policy (ii), considered as the one best reproducing the operational reality of companies, is incorporated to the BE modeling as a correction factor when quantifying the phenomenon. We thus present a new mathematical model to quantify the BE in situations where both demand and lead time are stochastic, and where inventory excesses are considered in the determination of future orders. The development of the new model is presented along with computational simulations run to compare its performance with models in Chen et al. (2000) and Fioriolli \& Fogliatto (2007).},

	abstract = {Drawing evidence from financial theory, which suggests the tendency of investors to sell winning stocks quickly and to hold on to losing ones for a long time, this is the first study to investigate the relevance of the effect of disposition bias on individual investors in the Tunisian equities market. Our analysis is carried out on a sample of 925 Tunisian traders over the period 2009–2014 to find out how gender, age, investor characteristics, portfolio management types, bull or bear market conditions, and external factors are related to the intensity of the disposition effect by separately tracking their trading transaction histories. The findings show mainly robust evidence of disposition bias across different groups of investors. In particular, the study reveals that male and younger Tunisian investors suffer from a strong disposition bias compared with their counterparts, female and mature investors. Furthermore, our results show that other behavioral biases, including market trading volume, the value of a share traded, trading frequency, trading in round numbers, and the investor's overall level of portfolio diversification depend on the disposition effect. Concerning the bull and bear market issue, we divided our data period into bull and bear markets to observe the effect of disposition bias every month of the year, and we found that this effect is even more pronounced in bull markets.},

We discuss these two topics, and then present a number of behavioral finance applications: to the aggregate stock market, to the cross-section of average returns, to individual trading behavior, and to corporate finance.

It is particularly suitable for science mapping at a time when the emphasis on empirical contributions is producing voluminous, fragmented, and controversial research streams. Science mapping is complex and unwieldly because it is multi-step and frequently requires numerous and diverse software tools, which are not all necessarily freeware. Although automated workflows that integrate these software tools into an organized data flow are emerging, in this paper we propose a unique open-source tool, designed by the authors, called bibliometrix, for performing comprehensive science mapping analysis. bibliometrix supports a recommended workflow to perform bibliometric analyses. As it is programmed in R, the proposed tool is flexible and can be rapidly upgraded and integrated with other statistical R-packages. It is therefore useful in a constantly changing science such as bibliometrics.},

Not only is it a time consuming task, it also requires suitable criteria, since the researchers need to elect systematically the most relevant literature works. Thus the objective of this paper is to propose the methodology called Methodi Ordinatio, which presents criteria to select scientific articles. This methodology employs an adaptation of the ProKnow-C for selection of publications and the InOrdinatio, which is an index to rank by relevance the works selected. This index crosses the three main factors under evaluation in a paper: impact factor, year of publication and number of citations. When applying the equation, the researchers identify among the works selected the most relevant ones to be in their bibliographic portfolio. As a practical application, it is provided a research sample on the theme technology transfer models comprising papers from 1990 to 2015. The results indicated that the methodology is efficient regarding the objectives proposed, and the most relevant papers on technology transfer models are presented.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the association of demographic characteristics, market conditions and risk taking with the disposition effect using data on Brazilian individual investors. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a unique data set with monthly data from June 2007 to February 2017 provided by one of the largest asset management firms in Brazil. This paper computes the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized to see if investors incur the disposition effect. This paper then performs logistic regressions to verify the association between investors’ disposition effects and demographic and portfolio characteristics. This paper analyses the prevalence of cognitive biases depending on market conditions (bull or bear markets) and include regressions by asset class as robustness checks. Findings This paper finds evidence that risk averse investors are more prone to the disposition effect, male subjects are less prone to this cognitive bias and age is not associated with the disposition effect. This paper observes that the tendency to incur the disposition effect decreases during bull markets but increases during bear markets. Also, this paper finds that sophisticated investors are more prone to selling winning assets and holding on to losses. Research limitations/implications First, paper gains and losses are based on the highest and lowest prices of the month and not on the price at the moment the sale occurred. Second, this paper had access only to end-of-month information, not to actual daily trading records. Third, because the data set relates to individual investors who trade investment funds, this paper cannot determine whether firm size is associated with the disposition effect. Fourth, age may not necessarily be a proxy for investor experience, so one should interpret the lack of significance for age in terms of generational differences. Practical implications This paper demonstrates that the disposition effect is prevalent even among wealthier and more educated investors with delegated asset classes. This paper also presents evidence on the association between demographic characteristics and cognitive biases considering a liquidity-constrained, highly volatile and developing market. Social implications This paper demonstrates that gender is an important characteristic to understand cognitive biases and that investor sophistication may not necessarily be an attenuation factor for the disposition effect in a liquidity-constrained market. Originality/value This is the first study to analyse the role of demographic characteristics and risk taking to explain the disposition effect using real information at the individual level about Brazilian investors. It is also the first to analyse the intensity of cognitive biases during bull and bear markets in the Brazilian economy.},

A pesquisa visa a compreender a lógica do processo de tomada de decisão financeira de parte do segmento de pessoas físicas no Brasil. Para isso, foi realizada uma investigação das heurísticas e dos vieses presentes na tomada de decisão dessas pessoas, considerando que o investidor e o consumidor são influenciados por diversos aspectos psicológicos e racionais. Uma pesquisa baseada em fundamentos básicos de Finanças Comportamentais foi aplicada em uma amostra demograficamente qualificada de assinantes de uma das principais editoras brasileiras de revistas. Desse total, obteve-se resposta, via Internet, de 641 brasileiros segmentados por gênero, idade, renda e escolaridade. Na pesquisa, avaliou-se, em cada grupo, a presença de heurísticas e vieses como, por exemplo, excesso de confiança, representatividade, ancoragem e procrastinação. Os resultados da pesquisa mostraram que tanto a razão quanto a emoção influenciaram nas respostas da predominância dos participantes da amostra. A maioria das pessoas considera que seu comportamento financeiro é mais racional do que o de seus pares. Como se esperava, o estudo indicou diferenças significativas no comportamento de acordo com o gênero, idade, escolaridade e renda.},

A life course approach and logistic regression were used to assess whether members of four different age cohorts altered their retirement planning activities. Older cohorts were more likely to have sought advice from a financial planner but were less likely to have increased time spent educating themselves about financial topics. Older cohorts were also less likely to be saving more for retirement and more likely to be delaying retirement compared to the youngest cohort. The youngest cohort members were relatively more likely to be confident that they will have sufficient funds to live comfortably after retirement. Older cohorts responded to the Great Recession by seeking safety for their retirement assets, and they resigned themselves to working longer before retirement.},

Experimental evidence suggests that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance, but we do not find evidence that high‐sustainability funds outperform low‐sustainability funds.

We find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios (relative to non-donors or Republican donors) in industries that are deemed socially irresponsible (e.g. tobacco, guns and defense, natural resources). Although a higher fraction of Democrat-run mutual funds are socially responsible (SRI), this result holds for non-SRI funds and after controlling for other fund and manager characteristics. The effect is more than one-half of the under-weighting observed for SRI funds. Using the KLD score to measure firm responsibility, we find that Democrat managers also tilt towards firms with positive social features such as excellent employee relations and clean environmental records. We document similar results among a smaller sample of hedge fund managers, suggesting that lax corporate governance in the mutual fund industry is not the main driver of our results. We discuss how political values influence investing and the implications of our findings for the growing SRI movement and stock prices. A simple calibration shows that the pricing implications of Democrat managers' preference for social responsibility are similar in magnitude to the S\&P 500 inclusion effect.},

	abstract = {With the erosion of strong class theory, sociologists have recently started to look at aspects of social stratification other than class. One of the most interesting new areas of investigation is the sociology of generations. This book brings together the work of scholars who are making a major contribution to this new sociological interest. Through a combination of innovative theoretical and empirical studies, this book shows that an analysis of generations is essential to an understanding of major social, political and intellectual trends in the postwar period. Each author brings to the volume insights from their own area of specialism - with rich illustrative material spanning topics as diverse as African American identity and Spanish youth culture. Theoretical inspiration also comes from a range of traditions, including cultural and historical sociology; social interactionism; social and cognitive psychology and life course theory. However, a unifying thread emerges around questions about how generations should be conceptualized; the role of trauma generating generational consciousness; the relationship between auto-biography and generational identity and the nature of inter and intra-generational relationships. This volume, therefore, provides a lively contribution to debates about the nature of generations and a stimulating basis for further work in this area.},

Employing Pierre Bourdieu's distinction between cultural and economic capital, it considers the formation of generations around political events, shared culture and strategic advantage. Generational conflict is structurally organized around the tensions between early retirement, age-related competency, legislation on ageism, and youth unemployment. Given rapid and radical changes to the labour market, generational cohesion is an important dimension therefore of strategies of social closure.]},

	abstract = {This paper presents a critical review of the theoretical basis and empirical evidence for the popular practitioner idea that there are generational differences in work values. The concept of generations has a strong basis in sociological theory, but the academic empirical evidence for generational differences in work values is, at best, mixed. Many studies are unable to find the predicted differences in work values, and those that do often fail to distinguish between ?generation? and ?age? as possible drivers of such observed differences. In addition, the empirical literature is fraught with methodological limitations through the use of cross-sectional research designs in most studies, confusion about the definition of a generation as opposed to a cohort, and a lack of consideration for differences in national context, gender and ethnicity. Given the multitude of problems inherent in the evidence on generational differences in work values, it is not clear what value the notion of generations has for practitioners, and this may suggest that the concept be ignored. Ultimately, it may not matter to practitioners whether differences in the values of different birth cohorts reflect true generational effects, provided one can reliably demonstrate that these differences do exist. However, at present this is not the case, and therefore significant research is required first to disentangle cohort and generational effects from those caused by age or period. The suggestion that different groups of employees have different values and preferences, based on both age and other factors such as gender, remains a useful idea for managers; but a convincing case for consideration of generation as an additional distinguishing factor has yet to be made.},

Personal values are subjective in nature, and reflect what people think and state about themselves. Consequently, both researchers and laymen sometimes question the usefulness of personal values in influencing action. Yet, self-reported values predict a large variety of attitudes, preferences and overt behaviours. Individuals act in ways that allow them to express their important values and attain the goals underlying them. Thus, understanding personal values means understanding human behaviour.},

Across three studies, the authors show that the effect of issue capability is moderated by gender, depending on the compatibility between the goal orientation of the decision maker and the nature of the decision task. For decisions that are mainly driven by achievement of gains (e.g., investment decisions), men's risk-taking propensity is more influenced by their levels of issue capability than women's because the nature of the decision task is consistent with men's agentic orientation focused on the self. Conversely, for decisions that are mainly driven by avoidance of losses (e.g., insurance decisions), women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability than men's because the nature of such decisions is consistent with women's communion orientation. The authors analyze the betting data from the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! game show (Study 1). The results show that gender moderates the effect of issue capability on the actual betting behavior in Jeopardy! In Study 2, the authors test the underlying mechanism through mediation analyses of the focus of attention. In Study 3, the authors manipulate the task nature and demonstrate that men's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in investment decisions, whereas women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability in insurance decisions.

The studies also use different samples of U.S. consumers, including online panels, a large-scale data set spanning five election cycles, and a secondary data set of political donations made by managers at companies. Finally, the authors articulate and demonstrate the mediating effect of individuals? focus on the upside potential of a decision among conservatives but not liberals.},

	abstract = {Four human values are considered to underlie individuals’ environmental beliefs and behaviors: biospheric (i.e., concern for environment), altruistic (i.e., concern for others), egoistic (i.e., concern for personal resources) and hedonic values (i.e., concern for pleasure and comfort). These values are typically measured with an adapted and shortened version of the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS), to which we refer as the Environmental-SVS (E-SVS). Despite being well-validated, recent research has indicated some concerns about the SVS methodology (e.g., comprehensibility, self-presentation biases) and suggested an alternative method of measuring human values: The Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ). However, the PVQ has not yet been adapted and applied to measure values most relevant to understand environmental beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, we tested the Environmental-PVQ (E-PVQ) – a PVQ variant of E-SVS –and compared it with the E-SVS in two studies. Our findings provide strong support for the validity and reliability of both the E-SVS and E-PVQ. In addition, we find that respondents slightly preferred the E-PVQ over the E-SVS (Study 1). In general, both scales correlate similarly to environmental self-identity (Study 1), energy behaviors (Studies 1 and 2), pro-environmental personal norms, climate change beliefs and policy support (Study 2). Accordingly, both methodologies show highly similar results and seem well-suited for measuring human values underlying environmental behaviors and beliefs.},

This chapter addresses the universals in the content and structure of values, concentrating on the theoretical advances and empirical tests in 20 countries, and its four basic issues: substantive contents of human values; identification of comprehensive set of values; extent to which the meaning of particular values was equivalent for different groups of people; and how the relations among different values was structured. Substantial progress has been made toward resolving each of these issues. Ten motivationally distinct value types that were likely to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form value priorities were identified. Set of value types that was relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of values to which individuals attribute at least moderate importance as criteria of evaluation was demonstrated. The evidence from 20 countries was assembled, showing that the meaning of the value types and most of the single values that constitute them was reasonably equivalent across most groups. Two basic dimensions that organize value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities were discovered. By identifying universal aspects of value content and structure, the chapter has laid the foundations for investigating culture-specific aspects in the future.},

Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding self-accountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals.},

Related, are these same people more willing to support policy actions aimed at preventing future losses when compared to older adults? In spite of reporting by the U.S. popular press about the heightened environmental consciousness of Millennials, prior research offers conflicting answers. Scholarship focusing on age effects suggests that the answer to both questions is yes due to the dampening of environmental concern and action in older adults. More recent applied research on climate related risks and risk management options, by contrast, suggest that the answer to both questions is no, and that there is no difference in climate concern and risk mitigation between younger and older adults. In an attempt to disentangle these contradictory viewpoints, we undertook a study in which respondents in the United States characterized by age and generational cohort were presented with small and large hypothetical losses due to climate change. These same participants were then asked to indicate their support for future policy actions aimed at stemming these environmental losses. Overall, our data does not indicate that younger generations experience potential losses as more acute than older generations; neither age nor generational cohort correlated with the perceived severity of environmental losses nor support for future actions to prevent them. More robust predictors of both dependent variables were environmental value orientations (biospherism) and self-reported political orientation.},

Current generational differences in worker values are analysed and the results are compared to a similar study conducted in 1974. Results suggest that generational work values do differ. To a lesser degree, the results suggest that work values also change as workers grow older. Finally, the results indicate an increasing desire among American workers to balance work and personal goals. This change in attitude was reflected even within the same cohort group.

Exp 1 focused on a total of 1,731 members of the 4 religions in 4 countries where each is the dominant religion: Greece, the Netherlands, Spain, and Israel. Ss rated the importance of each of the 10 value sets as a guiding principle in their lives. Exp 2 compared responses of 849 Protestants and 827 Roman Catholics in West Germany. Results suggest that valuing certainty, self-restraint, and submission to superior external verities inclines people to become more religious in general; valuing openness to change and free self-expression inclines people to become less religious.

Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1964-2004, we find that individuals who have experienced low stock-market returns throughout their lives report lower willingness to take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the stock market, and, conditional on participating, invest a lower fraction of their liquid assets in stocks. Individuals who have experienced low bond returns are less likely to own bonds. All results are estimated controlling for age, year effects, and a broad set of household characteristics. Our estimates indicate that more recent return experiences have stronger effects, but experiences early in life still have significant influence, even several decades later. Our results can explain, for example, the relatively low stock-market participation of young households in the early 1980s, following the disappointing stock-market returns in the 1970s, and the relatively high participation of young investors in the late 1990s, following the boom years in the 1990s. In the aggregate, investors' lifetime stock-market return experiences predict aggregate stock-price dynamics as captured by the price-earnings ratio.},

Following extant literature in behavioral finance, we argue that a society’s culture and the cultural distance between two markets play an important role in explaining the foreign bias. In particular, we hypothesize that the degree of a nation’s uncertainty avoidance affects the foreign bias (more uncertainty-avoiding countries allocate less to foreign markets), as does the degree of a country’s individualism (in individualistic countries performance is more directly attributed to a person and less to teams, causing these individuals to be more aggressive in their foreign asset allocations). We further expect that the degree of cultural distance between two countries affects the amount of money allocated to that market. Based on extensive robustness analyses, we find support for our hypotheses on the role of culture in international asset allocation.},

Despite the potential of this group as a whole, especially the middle-aged members of this generation (ages 18–22) who are in the highly coveted college-student market, much is unknown about the motivations behind these individuals' consumption behavior and preferences. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by exploring the antecedents of the consumption behavior of college-aged Generation Y individuals. The findings indicate that issues relating to socialization, uncertainty reduction, reactance, self-discrepancy, and feelings of accomplishment and connectedness drive Y consumers' product purchases and retail patronage. This article discusses these issues as well as their theoretical and managerial implications.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the limits and possibilities of research in the sociology of generation by taking the ?thirtysomething? cohort as a case study. It addresses a number of critical research issues, namely: how does one identify the parameters of a generation? Are there different sorts of generations, and if so how can this fact be established? And how can one deal with the internal diversity of generations, both in terms of their stratification and in the lived experiences of its members? The empirical research for this study was conducted using focus groups, and analysis loosely follows a grounded theory approach. In the paper, I reflect upon how the context of doing research in an ?entertainment and consumer society? might affect the research process and its findings. This leads me to conclude that research methods themselves have an historicizing character, and that sociology also has a generational flavour.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify important factors that affect Hong Kong adolescent consumers' green purchasing behaviour. Design/methodology/approach A total of 6,010 (2,975 males and 3,035 females) adolescents in Hong Kong were recruited through multi‐staged random sampling. They were surveyed on their green purchasing behaviour, environmental attitude, environmental concern, perceived seriousness of environmental problems, perceived environmental responsibility, perceived effectiveness of environmental behaviour, social influence and concern for self‐image in environmental protection. Findings Multiple regression analysis showed that social influence was the top predictor of Hong Kong adolescents' green purchasing behaviour, followed by environmental concern as the second, concern for self‐image in environmental protection as the third, and perceived environmental responsibility as the fourth top predictor. Research limitations/implications A major limitation of this study lies in the self‐reported nature of the survey used. Future study should include some objective assessments (such as observations or other‐reported survey) of the subjects' green purchasing behaviour. Practical implications This paper is a useful source of information for international green marketers about what works and what does not in appealing to the young consumers in Hong Kong. Originality/value This paper serves as a pioneer study to identify important factors in affecting young consumers' green purchasing behaviour in the Hong Kong context. It offers practical guidelines to international green marketers planning to target the Asian markets.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This article aims to provide a comparison between the patterns of brand loyalty of five consumer groups – three groups of Millennials and two groups of Generation X consumers. To avoid reductionist generalizations, the study takes into account several market-related situations – considering three types of products and two types of services, and investigates also the differences between the customer loyalty profile in two European Union countries with a different level of economic development: France and Romania. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected and analyzed in three main phases: first, secondary data have been analyzed to identify and formulate the research framework; second, a series of focus groups have been conducted with French and Romanian consumers; and third, 500 questionnaires have been applied in each of the two investigated countries. Findings – The findings demonstrate the significant effect of the life-stage model, the Millennials and Generation X consumers included in similar life-stage groups displaying a highly similar pattern of brand loyalty behavior, and close preferences regarding the elements used for brand evaluation. On the other hand, the findings show important variations induced by the market-related situations, and by the different level of economic development of the two investigated countries. Practical implications – The findings of this study demonstrate the complexity of the brand loyalty effect and provide valuable insights into the brand loyalty behavior of five consumer groups both for academics and marketers. Originality/value – This study demonstrates that the effect of consumer life-stage on the brand loyalty behavior of various consumer groups is stronger than the inter-generational effect. This effect is demonstrated both for product and service brands, considering several market situations.},

Questions probed self-identity, relevance of depictions in the media, and the informational value of advertising across eight media. Results show that gender and a variety of personality traits such as introversion/extroversion affect both the perceived value of advertising as an information source and the relevance of depictions in the media. Depictions in movies and television were rated significantly better than depictions in advertising.

Using data from the Maryland daily numbers game, we find a clear and consistent tendency for the amount of money bet on a particular number to fall sharply immediately after it is drawn, and then gradually to recover to its former level over the course of several months.

There may be a trade-off between financial and psychic returns for some investors. The trade-off for consumption-investors is expected to be close to zero (total utility is maximised with small levels of ethical investment in the fun of participation model) and is expected to vary with the ethical intensity of investment-investors, as shown when we include ethical intensity into the investor's utility function. Psychic return can also be viewed as an increase in happiness and this approach would lend itself to empirical testing to increase our understanding of why we invest ethically.},

While there is little doubt about the existence of the bias, its magnitude varies across countries and investor groups. The home bias has to be regarded as a multifactorial phenomenon, a combination of numerous causes which all synergistically contribute. In contrast to other biases the home bias can at least partially be explained by reasons beyond irrational investor behaviour. While institutional restrictions play a minor role, informational asymmetries and superior information of domestic investors are important factors. Thus, the performance of investments may well benefit from a home bias, and the bias then no longer would be a puzzle but rather rational behaviour as a lower diversification level may lead to higher returns. The contemporary understanding of the home bias gains in relevance as the ongoing political debate in Germany has to clarify an institutional framework for long-run retirement savings plans of private households based on equity investments.},

We found four common ways of dealing with this problem: they divided up their money into core and surplus accounts; they decided that it was enough to only be a partial ethical investor; they avoided detailed consideration of the costs of ethical investment, and they avoided rigorous ethical thinking. One equilibrium position arising from these responses is a portfolio approach to ethics, which allows people to assuage their consciences by investing only a small proportion of their investments ethically, while leaving the rest in non-ethical investment vehicles.]},

The primary objective of the present study is to develop a scale designed to measure SRC in France. Through the scale development process we attempt to identify whether French consumers share the same ecological and social concerns with their US counterparts as Roberts' (1995; 1996) work might suggest, or is their SRC more idiosyncratic in nature. Our scale building process led to a five-factor SRC scale. It appears that French consumers do exhibit social and environmental concerns, but ones that differ somewhat from those exhibited by US consumers. The factors generated from our scale building process focused on corporate responsibility, country of origin preferences, shopping at local or small businesses, purchasing cause-related products, and reducing one's consumption. Implications of the present study's findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Due to an increasing awareness in environmental impact, consumers are more sensitive towards green products when making their purchasing decisions. The young generation, who represents the future of our society, seems to have a different attitude and belief which enables them to reflect on their choice of green products. This research empirically examines the influence of ecological affect and ecological knowledge on the green purchasing behaviour of the young generation. A survey was administered to young consumers between the age of 18 and 30. Structural equation modelling was applied to test the hypotheses. The analysis result confirms that the ecological effect and knowledge are significant in determining young consumers' green involvement as well as their actual purchase.},

	doi = {10.1108/MRR-01-2015-0015},
	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the role personal values play in investment decision-making processes among Ghanaian shareholders. Design/methodology/approach In consequence of the recent emergence of the issue of corporate governance practices in Ghana, and the kind of the research objective of this paper, a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods was used. These methods were used in two stages. The first stage was qualitative, which purposively selected 20 individual shareholders to solicit their perspectives on how personal values influence investment decisions. Their responses were used to construct the content of this enquiry. The second stage, which was quantitative, used stratified sampling technique to select 503 individual shareholders to confirm the responses obtained from stage one of the enquiry. Findings The findings of the study reveal that individual shareholders in Ghana hold value priorities and that honesty, a comfortable life and family security play a significant role in their lives and their investment decision-making processes, and the kind of companies they choose to invest in. Also, to Ghanaian individual shareholders, there is a clear distinction between a comfortable life and a prosperous life in the sense that they are not incentivized more by the latter but by the former in their investment decisions. Practical implications The results can inform corporate directors and managers what values are considered in investment decisions, and that it is not purely financial. With these results, they can be informed that while some financial values are important, it is just to live a comfortable life and not a prosperous life. This may influence these directors and managers to have a more long-run focus and to have more of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) focus by putting implementable measures in place to tackle corporate responsibility issues and to take up a responsibility for their CSR feat. Also, the results can be used for public policy in that if regulators find out that more CSR-type information is important to investors, they might require additional CSR-type disclosures in financial statements. Originality/value This paper contributes to the knowledge on the stakeholder perspective of corporate governance that individual shareholders’ personal values have influence on their investment decisions and the choice of companies they invest in.},

	abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this paper is to identify the generational cohort effect on responsible consumer behavior. Based on the theory of planned behavior and the generational cohort theory, the authors test the impact of perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE), media exposure (ME), the social group influence of family and peers and self-identity on the intention of Generation X and Generation Y to purchase environmentally responsible products. Design/methodology/approach-The data were collected from 1,870 respondents in France. Based on the factor scores from a confirmatory factor analysis, the authors tested for interaction effects by employing regression and path analyses. A two-group structural model evaluated the strength of each cohort's direct effects and the significant differences between the groups. Findings-The results reveal a generational (cohort) effect on the relationship between PCE and ME and the intention to purchase environmentally responsible products. Practical implications -To increase consumers' personal involvement in responsible purchasing behaviors, marketers could cater to the social desirability side of Gen Y by emphasizing products that express community values; on the other hand, marketers could appeal to the PCE of Gen X by providing more information and convincing them that their actions matter. Social implications -The efficiency of awareness and promotional campaigns for environmentally responsible products will be enhanced when marketers employ segmentation based on generational cohorts. Originality/value-The study contributes to a better understanding of responsible consumer behavior by identifying generational cohort differences.},

Argumenta-se que esse novo campo de pesquisa é essencialmente uma reação ao fracasso da “hipótese dos mercados eficientes” de explicar uma ampla gama de fenômenos financeiros recorrentemente observados, tais como a (parcial) previsibilidade dos retornos dos ativos financeiros, volumes excessivos de negociação, e a diversificação ingênua. Enfatiza-se, ainda, que a Finança Comportamental, movida pelo intento de explicar essas “anomalias”, rejeita o pressuposto da racionalidade ilimitada e adota uma perspectiva que incorpora na análise econômica contribuições da Psicologia e da Sociologia. Por isso, são analisados alguns componentes de seu arcabouço conceitual relacionados a vieses gerados por heurísticas (como heurística da disponibilidade, heurística da representatividade, ancoragem, excesso de confiança, dependência do contexto, contabilidade mental, e aversão à perda), e mostra-se como têm sido empregados para solucionar algumas das anomalias não explicadas pela teoria convencional de finanças.

Se você acha que a resposta é “Só mais do mesmo”, você está em uma surpresa. Howe e Strauss, os autores de Gerações, A Quarta Turna, Millennials em ascensão e outros livros, estudaram as diferenças entre as gerações há cerca de 30 anos. Sua extensa pesquisa revelou um padrão fascinante — um tão forte que suporta uma medida de previsibilidade. Com base no precedente histórico, dizem eles, podemos prever como as gerações que estão vivas hoje pensarão e agirão nas próximas décadas. Três dessas gerações ainda serão forças vitais na sociedade americana daqui a 20 anos: Boomers, Geração X e Millennials. Suas atitudes e comportamentos terão efeitos profundos na economia, no local de trabalho e nas instituições sociais em geral. Por exemplo, à medida que os Boomers envelhecidos evitam a medicina de alta tecnologia em favor do autocuidado holístico, alimentos naturais e técnicas de cura mente-corpo, alguns hospitais estão abrindo novas asas com medicina alternativa e aconselhamento espiritual. O general Xers, tendo crescido em uma era de escolas e casamentos fracassados, permanecerá alienado, descontente e pragmático à medida que entrarem na meia-idade. Já a maior geração empreendedora da história dos EUA, eles serão altamente eficazes para impulsionar a inovação, a eficiência e a personalização em massa. Em contraste, os jovens adultos Millennials favorecerão o trabalho em equipe, relacionamentos familiares próximos, segurança no trabalho e uma cultura popular sem graça. Seu empoderamento digital sem precedentes e talento para organização criarão uma potência política e podem até revitalizar o movimento sindical.},

Using factor analysis, we identified investment- and tobacco-related dimensions on which participants’ responses tended to load. Two of these factors, relating to the societal impact of investment decisions and the health effects of tobacco, were highly significant in determining whether participants selected a tobacco or non-tobacco related investment. More importantly, we found that when the rate of return on a tobacco-related investment exceeds the rate of return on an investment not involving tobacco by 1\%, the intensity of participant concerns about the societal effects of their investment decisions was especially important in determining investment choices. This finding indicates that traditional wealth-maximization approaches, which do not consider the personal values of the investor, omit an important factor that affects investment decisions.

	abstract = {The concept of generation within sociology has until recently been a marginal area of interest. However, various demographic, cultural and intellectual developments have re-awakened an interest in generations that started with the classic essay by Karl Mannheim. To date, the sociological literature has generally conceptualized generations as nationally bounded entities. In this paper we suggest that the sociology of generations should develop the concept of global generations. This conceptual enhancement is important because the growth of global communications technology has enabled traumatic events, in an unparalleled way, to be experienced globally. The late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the era of international generations, united through print media, and the mid-twentieth century saw the emergence of transnational generations, facilitated by new broadcast communications. However, the latter part of the twentieth century is the period of global generations, defined by electronic communications technology, which is characterized, uniquely, by increasing interactivity. The 1960s generation was the first global generation, the emergence of which had world-wide consequences; today with major developments in new electronic communications, there is even more potential for the emergence of global generations that can communicate across national boundaries and through time. If in the past historical traumas combined with available opportunities to create national generations, now globally experienced traumas, facilitated by new media technologies, have the potential for creating global generational consciousness. The media have become increasingly implicated in the formation of generational movements. Because we are talking about generations in the making rather than an historical generation, this article is necessarily speculative; it aims to provoke discussion and establish a new research agenda for work on generations.},

Challenges to the perspective of contextualism stem from the theory's hypotheses about linkages that mediate between cataclysmic events and psychological processes, the influence of historical generations on many of psychology's everyday concerns, and instructive comparisons with a body of growing research on processes involving adaptations to different cultures.},

Recognizing that our understanding of male shoppers can be improved by identifying smaller, more homogeneous sub-segments, this exploratory study uses Generational Cohort Theory (GCT) as a framework to examine the shopping orientations of US men across four different generational cohorts: the Silent generation, the Baby Boomers, the 13th Generation, and the Millennials. The findings of this study support the use of GCT as a market segmentation tool for male shoppers and provide insight to help retailers understand how men in the four cohort groups approach shopping. Specifically, the findings suggest that male shoppers in the Millennial generation exhibit significantly higher levels of shopping enjoyment, recreational shopping tendency and market mavenism than males in the other generational cohorts. © 2011.},

This theory has its roots in the 1930, but it was fully developed only in the 1950's, and became the standard theory in psychometrics in the 1980's. The IRT is one of the latent trait modeling theories that appeared in the 1930's. Latent trait modeling theories assume that the human behavior, called observable variables, is dependent and caused by latent traits, the hypothetical variables. The IRT assume this modeling and expresses the relationship between these two types of variables through a mathematical equation called the logistic equation. This equation produces a curve called the item characteristic curve (ICC). This curve defines the items parameters (difficulty, discrimination) in terms of the level of the latent trait, symbolized as theta (q). The paper also discusses the advantages that IRT offers over the traditional theory in psychometrics, that is, the classical theory of tests (CTT).},

Finally, we provide evidence that investors who are more prone to purchase stocks after irrelevant news have poorer stock-picking performance. We hypothesize that individuals tend to narrow their choice set to alternatives that attract attention.

Os impactos das finanças comportamentais nos mercados de capitais podem afetar as decisões econômicas, perpetuar ou aumentar anomalias na precificação de ativos e, em situações mais extremas e persistentes, contribuir para a formação de bolhas que podem comprometer todo o sistema financeiro de um país. O estudo traz, de maneira pioneira ao mercado de ações brasileiro, metodologia inovadora para identificar vieses comportamentais e obter retornos anormais e superiores aos retornos do Ibovespa. A pesquisa aplica o modelo desenvolvido por Gokhale et al. (2015) em três amostras com dados de cotações de empresas brasileiras de capital aberto que compõem o Ibovespa e o Índice Brasil Amplo (IBrA) no período 2005-2016. Com o software estatístico R, calculou-se o Índice Fundamental de Avaliação (Fundamental Valuation Index - FVI) para cada ação da amostra e a cada ano. A partir desse índice, identificaram-se as ações subavaliadas, indicando que o preço de venda não reflete seus fundamentos econômicos, e realizadas simulações de carteiras para investimento nos três meses ou no próximo ano. Os resultados indicam a possível existência de sobrerreação e vieses comportamentais no mercado de ações brasileiro que geram a possibilidade de retornos anormais superiores aos retornos do Índice Bovespa (Ibovespa). De forma similar ao mercado americano, as carteiras simuladas renderam, ao final do período de 2006-2016, mais de 274\%, enquanto o Ibovespa rendeu aproximadamente 80\%. Os testes de robustez confirmaram a eficácia do modelo. As diversas carteiras de investimento, simuladas em horizontes temporais distintos, renderam em média mais do que o Ibovespa.

Hindsight bias denotes people's tendency to overestimate, in hindsight, how predictable an outcome was in foresight, while anchoring bias refers to people's tendency to form their estimates for different categories, starting from a particular available, and often irrelevant, value and insufficiently adjusting their final judgments from this starting value. We carry out an experiment involving a group of MBA students, asking them to recall a number of recent economic and financial indicators (stock and bond market index returns, rates of inflation, currency exchange rates, etc.). We for document that significant hindsight and anchoring bias are exhibited, on average, each of our experimental questions and by vast majority of the participants. Furthermore, we document that women are more strongly affected by both behavioral biases. Possible reasons for this difference and potential implications are discussed.

	isbn = {978-3-319-20450-5},
	abstract = {Expected utility theory reigned for several decades as the dominant normative and descriptive model of decision making under uncertainty, but it has come under serious question in recent years. There is now general agreement that the theory does not provide an adequate description of individual choice: a substantial body of evidence shows that decision makers systematically violate its basic tenets. Many alternative models have been proposed in response to this empirical challenge (for reviews, see Camerer J Risk Uncertain 2:61–104, 1989; Fishburn Nonlinear preference and utility theory. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1988; Machina Econ Perspect 1(1):121–154, 1987). Some time ago we presented a model of choice, called prospect theory, which explained the major violations of expected utility theory in choices between risky prospects with a small number of outcomes (Kahneman and Tversky Econometrica 47:263–291, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman J Bus 59(4):S251–S278, 1986). The key elements of this theory are (1) a value function that is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains, and (2) a nonlinear transformation of the probability scale, which overweights small probabilities and underweights moderate and high probabilities. In an important later development, several authors (Quiggin J Econ Behav Organ 3, 323–343; Schmeidler Econometrica 57:571–587, 1989; Yaari Econometrica 55:95–115, 1987; Weymark Math Soc Sci 1:409–430, 1981) have advanced a new representation, called the rank-dependent or the cumulative functional, that transforms cumulative rather than individual probabilities. This article presents a new version of prospect theory that incorporates the cumulative functional and extends the theory to uncertain as well to risky prospects with any number of outcomes. The resulting model, called cumulative prospect theory, combines some of the attractive features of both developments (see also Luce and Fishburn J Risk Uncertain 4:29–59, 1991). It gives rise to different evaluations of gains and losses, which are not distinguished in the standard cumulative model, and it provides a unified treatment of both risk and uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The complex world of finance is characterised by numerous irrationalities that representatives of behavioral finance seek to explain by cognitive biases (flaws, inclinations or anomalies). Cognitive biases represent imperfect perception of reality and are caused by limited cognitive capacities of decision-makers. By analysing cognitive biases, the paper aims to answer the following questions that standard finance fails: Why active portfolio strategy is still the most influential strategy in portfolio management despite the mounting evidence of unsuitability of its application? Why investors prefer dividend payout over increase in capital value (dividend puzzle)? Why investors ignore benefits of investment diversification and choose to invest in a small number of shares of well-known local businesses (diversification puzzle)? Why investors avoid to sell "loser" shares and thus reduce the tax burden? Why shares of small companies usually bring higher returns compared to shares of large companies? The answers to these questions are obtained by using qualitative research methodology, which also represents the main result of the research.},

	abstract = {Executive Summary The TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index (P-Fin Index) measures knowledge and understanding which enable sound financial decision-making and effective management of personal finances. It is unique in its capacity to examine financial literacy across eight areas of personal finance in which individuals routinely function, as well as providing a robust indicator of overall personal finance knowledge and understanding. U.S. adults are split 50/50 between those who could and those who could not answer over one-half of the P-Fin Index questions correctly. Sixteen percent of Americans demonstrated a relatively high level of personal finance knowledge and understanding, i.e., they answered over 75\% of the index questions correctly. Twenty percent have a relatively low level of knowledge and understanding, answering 25\% or less of the questions correctly. Personal finance knowledge is lowest in the area of comprehending risk; on average, 39\% of these questions were answered correctly. This is troubling given that uncertainty is a common feature of financial decision-making. Future conditions are simply unknown, thus, comprehending risk and its implications is integral to making appropriate decisions. Basic personal finance behavior and habits often become established early in adulthood. Young adults also confront a range of financial decisions with ramifications for their financial well-being decades into the future, as well as the present. Yet they are working from a limited base of personal finance knowledge. While 10\% of young adults (under age 45) have a relatively high level of financial literacy, 30\% have a relatively low level. Comprehending risk and insuring are areas where young adult knowledge appears lowest. The P-Fin Index correlates with financial actions and outcomes in the expected manner, i.e., individuals with greater personal finance knowledge are more likely to have positive personal finance experiences, such as planning and saving for retirement and for other reasons. Overall, P-Fin Index data highlight the gap between current personal finance knowledge levels and the level needed for sound financial decision-making in the normal course of life. This, in turn, highlights the need for a renewed focus on efforts to improve financial literacy, particularly among the young who face many significant financial decisions early in their working lives.},

From the skill and anchor items scale, two smaller scales of nine and seven items were also derived for financial knowledge assessment. The scales proposed in this study innovate by differing from those commonly used in the literature, by considering not only the percentage of correct answers but also the parameters of the item that the individual answers correctly. The three scales have items from different levels of knowledge, allowing researchers, educators, and policymakers to choose which is the most appropriate to their objectives.},

Um dos pilares da HME é a possibilidade da arbitragem como mecanismo de correção de possíveis desvios que o mercado possa sofrer de sua forma eficiente.Pela teoria clássica dos mercados eficientes, mesmo em um ambiente caracterizado pela presença de alguns investidores não totalmente racionais, a possibilidade de arbitragem anularia o efeito destes nos preços dos ativos negociados, trazendo-os de volta ao seu valor fundamental. Um campo relativamente novo e de crescente importância das finanças, denominado Finanças Comportamentais, tem mostrado, entretanto, que nos mercados reais a possibilidade de arbitragem é, muitas vezes, custosa e não passível de realização, comprometendo sua utilização como ferramenta reguladora do mercado e, até mesmo, a definição clássica de sua eficiência, que é a de refletir corretamente nos preços as informações existentes sobre os ativos financeiros. Este trabalho aborda a importância da arbitragem para a HME, discutindo seus aspectos teóricos. Posteriormente, são levantados, através de uma abordagem derivada das Finanças Comportamentais, os principais problemas existentes quanto à sua efetiva utilização nos mercados reais e as conseqüências destes para a HME.},

De acordo com essa hipótese, esse tipo de mercado coloca à disposição dos agentes as opções ótimas para investir seu dinheiro, levando a uma alocação eficiente de capital. O objetivo deste artigo é mostrar que essa condição de fato não existe na realidade econômica e, como consequência, discutir como as formas alternativas de mercado de ativos norteiam o processo de investimento. As formas alternativas de alocação implicam que os agentes econômicos não seguem o modelo ideal de “racionalidade plena”, mas seguem uma “forma fraca” consistente com as decisões que devem ser tomadas em condições de incerteza. Essa análise nos permitirá construir modelos mais realistas de mercados financeiros, considerando não apenas suas condições de normalidade, mas também as circunstâncias que explicam sua instabilidade e crises.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

These investors demonstrate a strong preference for realizing winners rather than losers. Their behavior does not appear to be motivated by a desire to rebalance portfolios, or to avoid the higher trading costs of low priced stocks. Nor is it justified by subsequent portfolio performance.

The anchors are set at predetermined percentiles of the distribution of estimates in the calibration group (15th and 85th percentiles in this study). This procedure permits the transformation of anchored estimates into percentiles in the calibration group, allows pooling of results across problems, and provides a natural measure of the size of the effect.

Variáveis pessoais do decisor ou de contexto interferem nesse processo, com destaque para a variável conhecimento, tendo, por isso, ocupado um lugar cada vez mais relevante na literatura, ao se buscar verificar sua interveniência. Os vieses cognitivos, tais como a ancoragem, constituem, desse modo, o foco de diversos estudos que buscam averiguar sua influência, bem como o nível de conhecimento do decisor (seja especialista ou não especialista) sobre o assunto objeto da decisão. Assim, surge o problema desta pesquisa consiste em saber se o efeito da heurística da ancoragem é afetado pela manipulação do conhecimento dos decisores. Com o intuito de responder a essa pergunta, foi realizado um quase-experimento com 324 sujeitos decisores, divididos em Grupos de Calibragem e Grupos Experimentais, utilizando-se o Modelo de Jacowitz e Kahneman (1995). Como resultado principal, proveniente do teste de manipulação (Cozby, 2006) da variável de controle (o conhecimento), observa-se a não verificação de ancoragem em indivíduos especialistas submetidos a uma tarefa decisória relacionada ao seu campo de conhecimento, contrariando os achados de Northcraft e Neale (1987) e Dorow (2009).

	abstract = {The theory of the perspective and the changes of preference in the mainstream: a Lakatosean prospect. For many decades over the 20th Century, the mainstream of economics adopted a normative and axiomatic theory of individual behavior in which maximizing procedures were carried out by rationally unbounded agents. This status has been challenged on many grounds and alternative views from fields like psychology have found a way into the core of economics research frontier. Prospect theory, developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky since the 1970s, has provided a more empirical, inductive and descriptive theory of decision making. It has made significant inroads into mainstream microeconomics, shaking the habits of some of its practitioners. This paper first takes stock of its main devel- opments and then uses a Lakatosian framework to draw out its negative and positive heuristics. In what follows, its heuristics are compared to those of traditional rational decision-making theories. The differences between them are highlighted, pointing to changes in the mainstream of the profession and to new opportunities for research.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.]},

Furthermore, the results also prove the relevance of the works of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky for the field of Behavioral Economics and Finance, and Steven Hursh to Behavioral Economics. It is still possible to note that the field of Behavioral Economics encompasses subjects that connect human behavior with demand, consumption and price, with investments and with managerial decisions, as well as with the role played by heuristics and cognitive biases in decision-making processes. In turn, the field of Behavioral Finance is more focused on the study of errors of judgment and of decision-making characteristics in financial investments. Additionally, it is inferred that the field of Behavioral Economics is more wide-ranging than the field of Behavioral Finance, as the latter is a byproduct of Behavioral Economics. Finally, a conclusion is then reached, demonstrating that the fields of Behavioral Economics and Finance have turned into an important field of study.},

	abstract = {Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1{\textbackslash}\% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for “just-in-time” financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

	abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less literate than others. Moreover, the more financially literate are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

An analysis of the essence of the "oncogene position effect" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by "slow" viruses.},

	abstract = {Reaching tasks are commonly performed during daily activities and require anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) to ensure a stable posture during movement execution. Age-related changes in APAs may impact dynamic balance and cause postural instability during reaching tasks made from standing. The present study examined age differences in postural control during reaching to targets located at different heights. Fourteen young adults (aged 20.0±1.5 yrs) and 16 community-dwelling older adults (aged 73.4±5.3 yrs) participated in the study. The task involved reaching forward to grasp a cylinder, and returning to an upright position as fast and accurately as possible. Postural control was analyzed using the center of pressure (COP) during four phases of the task: COP displacement during APA production, COP trajectory smoothness during the reach and return phases, and COP path length during the recovery phase following movement. APA amplitude measured by COP displacement and COP path length during the recovery phase was larger in older compared to young adults. Dynamic balance represented by COP trajectory smoothness was reduced with age. In both age groups, APA amplitude was largest and COP trajectory smoothness the least during low target reaches. The results demonstrate that, while older adults can alter APAs in order to maintain postural stability, control of COP during movement execution, particularly during low target reaches, is compromised with aging. These findings have clinical implications for both the assessment of dynamic balance and the development of balance training programs.},
